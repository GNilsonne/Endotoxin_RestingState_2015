Data by Bianka Karshikoff, John Axelsson, Anna Andreasson, and Mats Lekander

Variables:
subject = Unique subject ID, numeric
group = Randomisation key, factor "Endotoxin" or "Placebo"
sex = Sex, factor "female" or "male"
HR_X = Heart rate, beats per minute, numeric. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4. Missing data were presumably not recorded in the first place.
temp_X = Core body temperature, degrees C, numeric. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
BP_systolic_X = Blood pressure, systolic, mm Hg, numeric. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
BP_diastolic_X = Blood pressure, diastolic, mm Hg, numeric. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
headache_X = Self-rated headache intensity, scale 0-9. TODO: Verify if 0-10, whether VAS or Likert-type. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
back_pain_X = Self-rated back pain intensity, scale 0-9. TODO: Verify if 0-10, whether VAS or Likert-type. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
nausea_X = Self-rated nausea, scale 0-9. TODO: Verify if 0-10, whether VAS or Likert-type. Five measures were made, yielding five columns where X = 0-4.
srh5_2 = Self-rated health on a 5-point Likert-type scale, numeric. This rating was only performed once, at the time which is called "2" for the following self-rated health measures
health_right_now_X = Self-rated health in the moment, scale 0-7, numeric. Three measures were made, yielding three columns where X = 1, 2, and 4.
sq = Sickness Questionnaire. TODO!
STAI_X = State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State subscale, numeric. Three measures were made, yielding three columns where X = 1-3.
PANAS_pos_X = Positive And Negative Affect Scale, Positive subscale, numeric. Three measures were made, yielding three columns where X = 1-3.
PANAS_neg_X = Positive And Negative Affect Scale, Negative subscale, numeric. Three measures were made, yielding three columns where X = 1-3.
stress_X = Self-rated stress, scale 0-100, numeric. Three measures were made, yielding three columns where X = 1-3.
IL6_X = Interleukin-6, pg/ml, numeric. Four measures were made, yielding four columns where X = 1-4. Values have not been log-transformed. Subject 8 at time 4, subject 31 at time 2, and subject 50 at time 3 have been excluded due to hemolysis in the blood sample and are left blank. Subject 43 at time 4 has missing data. 
IL8_X = Interleukin-8, pg/ml, numeric. Four measures were made, yielding four columns where X = 1-4. Values have not been log-transformed. Subject 8 at time 4, subject 31 at time 2, and subject 50 at time 3 have been excluded due to hemolysis in the blood sample and are left blank. Subject 43 at time 4 has missing data. 
IL10_X = Interleukin-10, pg/ml, numeric. Four measures were made, yielding four columns where X = 1-4. Values have not been log-transformed. Subject 8 at time 4, subject 31 at time 2, and subject 50 at time 3 have been excluded due to hemolysis in the blood sample and are left blank. Subject 43 at time 4 has missing data. 
IL13_X = Interleukin-13, pg/ml, numeric. Four measures were made, yielding four columns where X = 1-4. Values have not been log-transformed. Subject 8 at time 4, subject 31 at time 2, and subject 50 at time 3 have been excluded due to hemolysis in the blood sample and are left blank. Subject 43 at time 4 has missing data. 
TNF_X = Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, pg/ml, numeric. Four measures were made, yielding four columns where X = 1-4. Values have not been log-transformed. Subject 8 at time 4, subject 31 at time 2, and subject 50 at time 3 have been excluded due to hemolysis in the blood sample and are left blank. Subject 43 at time 4 has missing data. 
pain_threshold_baseline = Pressure on thumb required to reach threshold, kPa, numeric. 
pain_threshold_diff = Difference from baseline to second recording of pain thresholds, kPa, numeric.
midcingulate_insula_conn = Estimated strength of resting-state connectivity between midcingulate cortex and insula, numeric

Variables removed before publishing:
Date of experiment - removed in order to preserve participants' anonymity
Weight - removed in order to preserve participants' anonymity
Pregnancy - removed because it was redundant, no participants were pregnant
Usual self-reported health "brukar m√•" - removed as it was a text string entered in Swedish and not coded into any standard format
Usual self-reported fever frequency - removed as it was a text string entered in Swedish and not coded into any standard format
Usual self-reported freqency of staying home from work due to illness - removed as it was a text string entered in Swedish and not coded into any standard format
Self-reported subjective feeling at the same time as ratings of headache, back pain, and nausea - removed as it was a text string entered in Swedish and not coded into any standard format

In addition, more variables were recorded but not processed within the scope of the paper for which these data and analyses are used.
